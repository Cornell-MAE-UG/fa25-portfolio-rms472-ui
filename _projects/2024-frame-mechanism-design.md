In Engrd 2020, Statics for Engineers at Cornell we were asked to design a frame mecanism using a single beam, 3 pins, and an actuator. The selected actuator had a length of 1.2m and a max force of 35kN. The given dimensions the device had to be in was 1.5m by 0.5m rectangle. The top image shows the work in calculating the max load of 22.3kN
